# MinecraftJS
 A mini-clone of the hit game Minecraft, made in Javascript.

### Setup
Note that this doesn't require a backend. You can play this in-browser without any sort of environment. This even has offline support with saves! 
Simply clone the repository and navigate to the public folder then open `index.html.`

### Setup (extended)
This repository simply serves as a lightweight environment for playing MinecraftJS. Make sure you have Node.js installed locally on whatever machine you are on.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Minecraft-JS/MinecraftJS
$ cd MinecraftJS
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
You can now access MinecraftJS from `http://localhost:8080`.
